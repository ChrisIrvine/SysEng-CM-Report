## Essay Plan
- What is the main message of the paper?
	- Introduce the reader to the concept of CM and where it came from
	- How we already use it in our work and personal lives
	- Why we should embrace CM fully
	- What needs to be sacrificed in order to be "full" CM, both in work and personal lives
- I want to portray an overall positive message about CM and it's merits, but at the same time I do not want to lead the reader astray with false promises of "do this and all will be well". 
	- Ultimately, CM is work, and when done in industry it has a significant cost ... but siginificant benefits too
- Structure of Essay
	- Abstract (200 words)
		- Summary of entire paper, including findings and conclusions. NOT AN INTRODUCTION
	- Introduction (250 words)
		- Introduce and provide a definition of CM, hint towards the main benfits of CM
	- History and Modern Principles (750 words)
		- whirlwind history tour of CM, (300 words)
		- principles, if more than 4 pick out the key ones for this paper (450 words)
	- Daily use of CM
		- Work (300 words)
		- Personal (300 words)
	- Embracing CM fully
		- Benefits (to both work and personal, with relatable examples) (600 words)
		- Costs (400 words)
	- Conclusions (200 words)
		- Really want to use positive language here, as the section before is going to read in a negative manner
		- Hammer home the point that CM is a good answer to many problems, and once implemented it is easy and cost-effective
- Overall stratergy and plan
	- Very tight word count of 2500 for a big topic, as pictures are worth 1000 words and their captions are not counted towards the word count lets use and abuse them.
	- References, references everywhere. I am making a pretty big claim, so I need to find many reputable sources backing up my claim that CM techniques are good in the home as well as at work
